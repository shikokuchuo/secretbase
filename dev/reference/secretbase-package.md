# secretbase: Cryptographic Hash, Extendable-Output and Binary/Text Encoding Functions

Fast and memory-efficient streaming hash functions, binary/text encoding
and serialization. Hashes strings and raw vectors directly. Stream
hashes files which can be larger than memory, as well as in-memory
objects through R's serialization mechanism. Implements the SHA-256,
SHA-3 and 'Keccak' cryptographic hash functions, SHAKE256
extendable-output function (XOF), 'SipHash' pseudo-random function,
base64 and base58 encoding, 'CBOR' and 'JSON' serialization.
