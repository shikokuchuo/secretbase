# secretbase: Cryptographic Hash, Extendable-Output and Base64 Functions

Fast and memory-efficient streaming hash functions and base64 encoding /
decoding. Hashes strings and raw vectors directly. Stream hashes files
which can be larger than memory, as well as in-memory objects through
R's serialization mechanism. Implementations include the SHA-256, SHA-3
and 'Keccak' cryptographic hash functions, SHAKE256 extendable-output
function (XOF), and 'SipHash' pseudo-random function.
