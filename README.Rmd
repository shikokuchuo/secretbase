Fast and memory-efficient streaming hash functions and base64 encoding / decoding.

Hashes strings and raw vectors directly. Stream hashes files which can be larger than memory, as well as in-memory objects through R's serialization mechanism.

Implementations include the SHA-256, SHA-3 and 'Keccak' cryptographic hash functions, SHAKE256 extendable-output function (XOF), and 'SipHash' pseudo-random function.

### Installation

Install secretbase from CRAN:

```{r}
#| label: cran
#| eval: false
install.packages("secretbase")
```

### Overview

```{r}
#| label: secretbase
library(secretbase)
```

#### SHA-3
 
For the SHA-3 cryptographic hash algorithm, specify `bits` as one of `224`, `256`, `384` or `512`:

```{r}
#| label: sha3
sha3("secret base")
sha3("secret base", convert = FALSE)
sha3("秘密の基地の中", bits = 512L)
```

#### Stream hash R objects

Character strings and raw vectors are hashed directly.

All other objects are stream hashed using R serialization.

- memory-efficient as performed without allocation of the serialized object
- portable as always uses R serialization version 3, big-endian representation, skipping headers (which contain R version and native encoding information)

```{r}
#| label: streaming
sha3(data.frame(a = 1, b = 2), bits = 224L)
sha3(NULL)
```

#### Stream hash files

Files are read and hashed incrementally, accepting files larger than memory:
```{r}
#| label: files
file <- tempfile(); cat("secret base", file = file)
sha3(file = file)
```
```{r}
#| label: unlink
#| echo: false
unlink(file)
```

#### Hash to integer / SHAKE256 XOF

May be used as deterministic random seeds for R's pseudo random number generators (RNGs). <br />
Specify `convert = NA` and `bits = 32` for a single integer value:
```{r}
#| label: integer
shake256("秘密の基地の中", bits = 32L, convert = NA)
```

For use in parallel computing, this is a valid method for reducing to a negligible probability that RNGs in each process may overlap. This may be especially suitable when first-best alternatives such as using recursive streams are too expensive or unable to preserve reproducibility. <sup>[1]</sup>

#### Keccak

```{r}
#| label: keccak
keccak("secret base", bits = 384L)
```

#### SHA-256

```{r}
#| label: sha256
sha256("secret base")
```

For SHA-256 HMAC, pass to `key` a character string or raw vector:
```{r}
#| label: hmac
sha256("secret base", key = "秘密の基地の中")
```

#### SipHash

SipHash-1-3 is optimized for performance. Pass to `key` a character string or raw vector of up to 16 bytes (128 bits):
```{r}
#| label: siphash
siphash13("secret base", key = "秘密の基地の中")
```

#### Base64 Encoding / Decoding

Strings:
```{r}
#| label: base64str
base64enc("secret base")
base64dec(base64enc("secret base"))
```
Raw vectors:
```{r}
#| label: base64raw
base64enc(as.raw(c(1L, 2L, 4L)), convert = FALSE)
base64dec(base64enc(as.raw(c(1L, 2L, 4L))), convert = FALSE)
```
Serialized objects:
```{r}
#| label: base64ser
base64enc(data.frame())
base64dec(base64enc(data.frame()), convert = NA)
```

### Implementation

The SHA-3 Secure Hash Standard was published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2015 at [doi:10.6028/NIST.FIPS.202](https://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.202). SHA-3 is based on the Keccak algorithm, designed by G. Bertoni, J. Daemen, M. Peeters and G. Van Assche.

The SHA-256 Secure Hash Standard was published by NIST in 2002 at <https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2.pdf>.

The SHA-256, SHA-3, Keccak, and base64 implementations are based on those by the 'Mbed TLS' Trusted Firmware Project at <https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/mbed-tls>.

The SipHash family of pseudo-random functions by Jean-Philippe Aumasson and Daniel J. Bernstein was published in 2012 at <https://ia.cr/2012/351>. <sup>[2]</sup>

The SipHash implementation is based on that of Daniele Nicolodi, David Rheinsberg and Tom Gundersen at <https://github.com/c-util/c-siphash>, which is in turn based on the reference implementation by Jean-Philippe Aumasson and Daniel J. Bernstein released to the public domain at <https://github.com/veorq/SipHash>.
