SHA-3 cryptographic hash and SHAKE256 extendable-output functions (XOF).

The SHA-3 Secure Hash Standard was published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2015 at [doi:10.6028/NIST.FIPS.202](https://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.202).

Fast and memory-efficient implementation using the core algorithm from 'Mbed TLS' under the Trusted Firmware Project <https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/mbed-tls/>.

### Installation

Install the latest release from CRAN:

```{r cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("secretbase")
```

or the development version from rOpenSci R-universe:

```{r runiv, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("secretbase", repos = "https://shikokuchuo.r-universe.dev")
```

### Quick Start

`secretbase` offers the main function: `sha3()`.

To use:
 
 - SHA-3 cryptographic hash algorithm, specify 'bits' as one of `224`, `256`, `384` or `512`
 - SHAKE256 extendable-output function (XOF), specify any other arbitrary bit length

```{r secretbase}
library(secretbase)

sha3("secret base")

sha3("secret base", convert = FALSE)

sha3("秘密の基地の中", bits = 224)

sha3("", bits = 512)

```

Hash arbitrary R objects:

 - using R serialization in a memory-efficient 'streaming' manner without allocation of the serialized object
 - ensures portability by always using serialization v3 XDR, skipping the headers (which contain R version and encoding information)

```{r streaming}
sha3(data.frame(a = 1, b = 2), bits = 160)

sha3(NULL)
```

Hash files:

 - read in a streaming fashion so can be larger than memory

```{r files}
file <- tempfile(); cat("secret base", file = file)
sha3(file = file)
```
```{r unlink, echo=FALSE}
unlink(file)
```

Hash to integer:

 - specify 'convert' as `NA`
 - specify 'bits' as `32` for a single integer value

```{r integer}
sha3("秘密の基地の中", bits = 384, convert = NA)

sha3("秘密の基地の中", bits = 32, convert = NA)
```

These values may be supplied as deterministic (but indistinguishable from random) seeds for R's pseudo random number generators (RNGs).

For use in parallel computing, this is a valid method for reducing to a negligible probability that RNGs in each process may overlap. This may be especially suitable when first-best alternatives such as using recursive streams are too expensive or unable to preserve reproducibility. <sup>[1]</sup>

Other functions include the cryptographic hash algorithm `sha256()` and a fast non-algorithmic hash `xxh64()`.
