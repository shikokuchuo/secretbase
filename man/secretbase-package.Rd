\title{secretbase: Cryptographic Hash and Extendable-Output Functions}
\description{
SHA-3 cryptographic hash and SHAKE256 extendable-output functions (XOF). Fast
    and memory-efficient implementation using the core algorithm from 'Mbed
    TLS' under the Trusted Firmware Project
    <https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/mbed-tls/>. The SHA-3
    cryptographic hash functions are SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384 and
    SHA3-512, each an instance of the Keccak algorithm. SHAKE256 is one of
    the two XOFs of the SHA-3 family, along with SHAKE128 (not implemented).
