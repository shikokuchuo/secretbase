Title: Cryptographic Hash, Extendable-Output and Base64 Functions
Version: 1.0.3.9000
Description: Fast and memory-efficient streaming hash functions and base64
    encoding / decoding. Hashes strings and raw vectors directly. Stream hashes
    files potentially larger than memory, as well as in-memory objects through
    R's serialization mechanism. Implementations include the SHA-256, SHA-3 and
    'Keccak' cryptographic hash functions, SHAKE256 extendable-output function
    (XOF), and 'SipHash' pseudo-random function.
