Title: Cryptographic Hash and Extendable-Output Functions
Version: 0.2.0.9000
Description: SHA-256, SHA-3 cryptographic hash and SHAKE256 extendable-output
    functions (XOF). The SHA-3 Secure Hash Standard was published by the
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2015 at
    <doi:10.6028/NIST.FIPS.202>. The SHA-256 Secure Hash Standard was published
    by NIST in 2002 at
    <https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2.pdf>. Fast and
    memory-efficient implementation using the core algorithms from 'Mbed TLS'
    under the Trusted Firmware Project
    <https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/mbed-tls/>.
