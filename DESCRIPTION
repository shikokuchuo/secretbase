Description: Fast and memory-efficient streaming hash functions,
    binary/text encoding and serialization. Hashes strings and raw vectors
    directly.  Stream hashes files which can be larger than memory, as
    well as in-memory objects through R's serialization mechanism.
    Implements the SHA-256, SHA-3 and 'Keccak' cryptographic hash
    functions, SHAKE256 extendable-output function (XOF), 'SipHash'
    pseudo-random function, base64 and base58 encoding, 'CBOR' and 'JSON'
    serialization.
