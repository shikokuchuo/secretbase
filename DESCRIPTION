Description: Fast and memory-efficient streaming hash functions and base64
    encoding / decoding. Hashes strings and raw vectors directly. Stream
    hashes files which can be larger than memory, as well as in-memory
    objects through R's serialization mechanism. Implementations include
    the SHA-256, SHA-3 and 'Keccak' cryptographic hash functions, SHAKE256
    extendable-output function (XOF), and 'SipHash' pseudo-random
    function.
